/*
 Polymorphism
 simply means many forms
 same method can be defined in multi ways in different classes
 and same method can behave differeny in same class based on situation
 1. Dynamic PM => same method can be defined in multi ways in different classes
 2. Static PM =>  and same method can behave differeny in same class based on situation

 DP -> Method overriding -> handled by different implentation post inheritance by diff classes
 SP -> Method Overloading -> handled by parameters -> same func defined multiple times with diff number of parameters
